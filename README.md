# webdriver-w3c
Haskell bindings for the W3C WebDriver API

Disclaimer: It's very early days for this code. You're welcome to play with it and find bugs. :)

If you're determined to try it out, the [tutorial](https://github.com/nbloomf/webdriver-w3c/blob/master/doc/Tutorial.md) is a good place to start.

Stack tips:

* `stack ghci webdriver-w3c`: load the library in a ghci session
* `stack install`: install the demo program (not super useful)
* `stack haddock`: generate the docs
* `stack test --coverage`: run the tests and generate a coverage report

Special thanks to Jonathan Lipps' (Simplified Guide)[https://github.com/jlipps/simple-wd-spec] to the WebDriver spec.
