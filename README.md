# webdriver-w3c
Haskell bindings for the W3C WebDriver API

Disclaimer: It's very early days for this code. You're welcome to play with it and find bugs. :)

Stack tips:

* `stack ghci webdriver-w3c`: load the library in a ghci session
* `stack install`: install the demo program (not super useful)
* `stack haddock`: generate the docs
* `stack test --coverage`: run the tests and generate a coverage report
